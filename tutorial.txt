first create a project in pycharm with custom environment
pip install django
pip install djangorestframework

django-admin startproject drinks .

to start server:
python manage.py runserver

before running it we need to migrate :
python manage.py migrate

to create superuser (admin):
python manage.py createsuperuser

email: admin@drinks.com
username:admin
password:admin

so to create model for drinks 
create models.py inside drinks

after creating model 

python manage.py makemigrations drinks

this causes an error so to solve it add your app "drinks" to settings.py Installed_apps

python manage.py migrate

To show our table in admin panel 
create admin.py


Then add 'rest_framework' in installed_apps

then create serializers.py

then create views.py

then change urls.py add views as path

now the read ability is working in CRUD

now we use decorators "apiview"
